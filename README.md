- 3D Sun and planets
- Planet rotation and orbital animation
- Space environment using an HDR background
- Interactive camera controls
- Runs directly in the browser
- 1 Second = 1 day on Earth
- Real-time scales
- Ellipses to simulate real-time planets' rotation around the sun
- Graphs to control the planet's speed according to its closeness to the sun
